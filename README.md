# Meta-Ad-performance-dashboard

# Project headline

This interactive Meta Ad Performance Dashboard offers an in-depth overview of ad performance across Facebook and Instagram campaigns. It enables marketing teams to monitor, compare, and enhance their advertising strategies through clear visualizations of impressions, engagement, conversions, and audience demographics.

# Objective

This project aims to explore and interpret Meta ad performance from multiple analytical viewpoints, such as audience segments, regional trends, and ad categories to identify key drivers of engagement and conversion. The insights derived are intended to support strategic decision-making and improve advertising.

# Overall breakdown

At the top of the dashboard, the ads generated 216K impressions and 25.4K clicks, giving a very high CTR of 11.76%. The engagement rate is also strong at 13.56%, showing users are interacting with the content. However, when we move down the dashboaed, only 1.3K purchases were made, giving a conversion rate of 5.21% from clicks and a purchase rate of 0.61% from impressions. This indicates a big drop in efficiency from engagement to purchase.

# Break Down by Audience 

1) Looking at demographics, females (43%) engage more than males (22%), and the 18–30 age group drives the majority of interactions. This shows the core audience is young females.
2) From a geographic perspective, India and Brazil are the biggest engagement markets, while Germany and the UK likely represent higher-value audiences with stronger purchasing power. So, campaigns should be tailored differently for high-volume vs. highvalue regions.

# Time & Seasonality 

The dashboard shows consistent weekly engagement, but hourly trends peak in the afternoon and evening hours.
The calendar highlights certain days (19th–21st, 25th–27th) with spikes in engagement, which could be linked to promotions or campaign launches. 

# Ad Type Performance

When we compare formats, Video ads perform best, with the highest CTR, conversion rate, and engagement rate. Stories ads also perform strongly, while images and carousels lag slightly in conversion efficiency.

# Summary

1. Strong awareness & engagement, but low purchase efficiency → optimize landing pages, retargeting, and offers. 
2. Target audience = young females, 18–30, in India & Brazil → refine campaigns accordingly. 
3. Best formats = Video and Stories → increase spend here. 
4. Best times = afternoons & evenings → schedule ads accordingly. 
5. Geography → volume from India/Brazil, value from Germany/UK → segment strategies.
